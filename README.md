# EMF-simulation-devops
-Inhouse Electric and Magnetic field Measurement Software Development(EMS)
--I undertook a project for the development of EMF 3D simulation software for visualizing Electromagnetic field (3D) beneath power transmission lines across India. I successfully completed this project within the stipulated time frame. The software aimed to develop a real-time simulation tool for visualizing EMF(3D) to avoid fatal incidents and mishaps due to electrocution and fires caused in proximity to power lines. During this project, I utilized Python, phpMyAdmin, and SQL for backend dev-ops, and CSS and HTML for web interface design. I also verified, tested, and eliminated run-time errors for the authentication of results of EMF measurements. I utilized Matplotlib and Pandas to plot and visualize EMF graphs in real-time.
