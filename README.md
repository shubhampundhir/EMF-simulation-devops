-Inhouse Electric and Magnetic field Measurement Software Development(EMS)
--Approach used in reference to Electric power research institute(EPRI),USA model in development of EMF simulating tool. PYTHON with PYCHARM IDE is used for the purpose of backend development of EMF measurement software. Along with it a user friendly interface created for manual inputs that are configured by the software and the output is interpreted and delivered using PHP,SQL and HTML.-Worked with Powergrid Advance Research and Development Center(PARTeC),Gurugram. -Block-chain prototype for vision of MODERNISATION OF POWERGRID. -Automated execution of smart contracts in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. -iDIGITAL POWERGRID. -Inhouse Electric and Magnetic field Measurement Software Development(EMS) Approach used in reference to Electric power research institute(EPRI),USA model in development of EMF simulating tool.
